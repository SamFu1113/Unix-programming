# Unix programming
 The material is from unix programming course.

## Why learning UNIX?
 + Academic research
    + Lots of open-source free software
    + Innovative software appears on UNIX first
    + Network computing research (cluster/grid)
    + Embedded system and SoC (system-on-chip)
    + Most of embedded software are Linux-based
    + MOST IMPORTANT: make you an expert on playing computer!



## Topics Covered

+ UNIX architecture
+ File System Operations
+ Terminal I/O
+ Concurrent Programming
+ process/thread, signals, semaphores, IPC, etc.
+ Network Computing
+ Socket, RPC

## Set up

- Setup your Linux
	- Use the embedded system LAB (dual-boot w/ Fedora)
	- Use your own computer
		- Most of Linux distribution (e.g. Fedora 9+) supports dual-boot
		- You can still have your M$-Windows with Linux

- Test the following software works
+ Terminal I/O
+ Concurrent Programming
+ process/thread, signals, semaphores, IPC, etc.
+ Network Computing
+ Socket, RPC
