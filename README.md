 The material is from unix programming course.

## Why learning UNIX?

 + Academic research
    + Lots of open-source free software
    + Innovative software appears on UNIX first
    + Network computing research (cluster/grid)
    + Embedded system and SoC (system-on-chip)
    + Most of embedded software are Linux-based
    + MOST IMPORTANT: make you an expert on playing computer!
